# Password Generator

- This gives anyone a secure randomly generated password to save and use.
- This generator provides different varieties of passwords depending on what characters you allow.
- This allows the user to create a password that is 8 - 128 characters long.
- Anything in the input that's not a number or is a number below 8 or above 128 will result invalid.
- Any prompts that are answered with "OK" are added to the randomly generated password.
- If none of the prompts are answered with "OK", the results will be invalid.
